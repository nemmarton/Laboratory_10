/* Task description:
Pretty print numbers

Write a function that prints the positive integer received as a parameter in an easy to read format: form groups of three digits and separate them by spaces. 
Example: 16 077 216. Test for other values, too: 999, 1000, 12, 0, 1000222.

Hint:
Use recursion, it is the same as printing in base 1000 numeral system.
To printf 3 digits with leading zeros use %03d in the format string.
